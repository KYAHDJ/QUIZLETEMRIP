<h2>NATURE OF PSYCHOLOGY <span class="topic-badge badge-part1">Part 1 - Topic 1</span></h2>

<h3>I. Definition of Psychology</h3>
<p>The term psychology derives from the Greek roots <em>psyche</em>, meaning "soul" or "mind," and <em>logos</em>, meaning word. Psychology is defined as the systematic study of behavior and experience. Psychologists deal with both theoretical and practical questions.</p>

<h3>Goals of Psychology:</h3>
<p><strong>A. Description:</strong> The first step in understanding anything is to give it a name. When you observe behavior and note everything about it: what is happening, where it happens, to whom it happens, and under what circumstances it seems to happen.</p>
<p><strong>B. Explanation:</strong> Finding explanations for a particular behavior is a crucial step in forming theories of behavior. It answers the question: "Why is the behavior happening?"</p>
<p><strong>C. Prediction:</strong> Determining what will happen in the future. From this goal, people usually think that a psychologist knows what a person thinks.</p>
<p><strong>D. Control:</strong> The modification of some behavior. Psychologists control to change the behavior from undesirable to desirable.</p>

<h3>II. Roots of Psychology</h3>
<p>Before it became an independent field of study, psychology came from philosophy and physiology. Among these philosophers is <strong>Aristotle</strong>, who wrote about the soul's relationship to the body. <strong>Plato</strong> wrote about dualism, which tells us that the soul could exist separately from the body. <strong>Descartes</strong> said that the pineal gland was the seat of the soul.</p>

<h3>III. The Emergence of Scientific Psychology</h3>
<p><strong>Structuralism:</strong> Wilhelm Wundt & Edward B. Titchener - Uses introspection to identify basic elements of structures of psychological experience.</p>
<p><strong>Functionalism:</strong> William James - Attempts to understand why animals and humans have developed the particular psychological aspects they possess.</p>
<p><strong>Gestalt Psychology:</strong> Max Wertheimer, Kurt Kafka, Wolfgang Kohler - Emphasizes that the whole of anything is more significant than its parts.</p>
<p><strong>Psychoanalysis:</strong> Sigmund Freud - Focuses on the unconscious mind, feelings, and early childhood experiences shaping our behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Behaviorism:</strong> B. F. Skinner, John B. Watson, Ivan Pavlov - Based on the premise that it is impossible to study the mind objectively.</p>

<h3>IV. Modern Perspectives</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Neurobiological/physiological approach:</strong> Understanding phenomena in terms of the human body, brain, nervous system, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Behavioristic perspective:</strong> Focuses on observable behaviors and learning principles.</li>
  <li><strong>Psychodynamic perspective:</strong> Focus on the unconscious mind and its influence on conscious behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Humanistic perspective:</strong> Assumes there is a human potential to be good and a fully functioning human being.</li>
  <li><strong>Evolutionary approach:</strong> Looks at all human behaviors in terms of adaptation and survival.</li>
  <li><strong>Epigenetics perspective:</strong> Context and learning through the context of genotype affect expression.</li>
  <li><strong>Eco-cultural perspective:</strong> Views psychological phenomena from the perspective of culture and ecology.</li>

<h2>NEUROBIOLOGICAL BASES OF BEHAVIOR <span class="topic-badge badge-part1">Part 1 - Topic 2</span></h2>

<h3>Neurons (Nerve Cells)</h3>
<p>Messages from other neurons are received from the branchlike structure called the <strong>dendrites</strong>. Nerve impulse then passes to the <strong>cell body or soma</strong>, which is also responsible for maintaining the cell's life. The message then passes through the <strong>axon</strong>, a tube-like structure, carrying it to the axon terminals.</p>

<p><strong>Glial cells</strong> serve as a structure in which the neurons develop and work. <strong>Myelin</strong> is the fatty substance that coats the axons of neurons to insulate, protect, and speed up neural impulses.</p>

<h3>The Brain - Major Structures</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cerebral cortex:</strong> Controls complex thought processes.</li>
  <li><strong>Corpus callosum:</strong> Connects left and right hemispheres of the brain.</li>
  <li><strong>Thalamus:</strong> Relays information from sensory organs to the cerebral cortex.</li>
  <li><strong>Hypothalamus:</strong> Regulates fear, thirst, sexual drive, and aggression.</li>
  <li><strong>Cerebellum:</strong> Controls balance and maintains muscle coordination.</li>
  <li><strong>Reticular formation:</strong> Controls arousal and attention.</li>
  <li><strong>Medulla:</strong> Controls heartbeat, breathing, and swallowing.</li>
  <li><strong>Pons:</strong> Influences sleep, dreaming, arousal, and coordination of movement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Limbic System</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Thalamus:</strong> Switching station that sends sensory information to proper areas of the cortex.</li>
  <li><strong>Hypothalamus:</strong> Controls hunger, thirst, sexual behavior, sleeping and waking, and emotions.</li>
  <li><strong>Hippocampus:</strong> Stores memories and remembers locations of objects.</li>
  <li><strong>Amygdala:</strong> Controls fear responses and memory of fearful stimuli.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lobes of the Brain</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Occipital lobes:</strong> Process vision.</li>
  <li><strong>Parietal lobe:</strong> Processes sense of touch, temperature, and body position.</li>
  <li><strong>Temporal lobes:</strong> Contain primary auditory area and involved in understanding language.</li>
  <li><strong>Frontal lobes:</strong> Contain motor cortex and higher mental functions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Peripheral Nervous System</h3>
<p>Two major divisions:</p>
<p><strong>Somatic division:</strong> Controls voluntary movements and communicates with sense organs.</p>
<p><strong>Autonomic division:</strong> Controls involuntary functions (heart, blood vessels, glands, lungs).</p>
<p><strong>Sympathetic division:</strong> Prepares body for action in stressful situations ("fight or flight").</p>
<p><strong>Parasympathetic division:</strong> Calms the body after emergency has ended.</p>

<h3>The Endocrine System</h3>
<p>Glands that make hormones, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hypothalamus:</strong> Connects endocrine system with nervous system.</li>
  <li><strong>Pituitary:</strong> Master gland of the endocrine system.</li>
  <li><strong>Pineal:</strong> Makes melatonin for sleep.</li>
  <li><strong>Thyroid:</strong> Makes thyroid hormone controlling metabolism.</li>
  <li><strong>Adrenals:</strong> Makes adrenaline ("fight or flight" hormone).</li>
  <li><strong>Pancreas:</strong> Makes insulin and glucagon.</li>
  <li><strong>Ovaries/Testes:</strong> Produce sex hormones.</li>
</ul>

<h2>HUMAN DEVELOPMENT <span class="topic-badge badge-part1">Part 1 - Topic 3</span></h2>

<h3>Nature versus Nurture</h3>
<p><strong>Nature:</strong> Heredity, the influence of inherited characteristics on personality, physical growth, intellectual growth, and social interactions.</p>
<p><strong>Nurture:</strong> The impact of the environment including parenting styles, physical surroundings, society, economic factors.</p>
<p>Conclusion: People are the product of the interaction between nature and nurture.</p>

<h3>DNA and Genetics</h3>
<p><strong>DNA</strong> is a special molecule that contains the genetic material of the organism. Humans have 46 chromosomes in each body cell; 23 from the mother's egg and 23 from the father's sperm.</p>
<p><strong>Dominant genes:</strong> More active in influencing the trait (e.g., brown hair color).</p>
<p><strong>Recessive genes:</strong> Less active, only expressed if paired with another recessive gene (e.g., blonde hair color).</p>

  <li>Identity vs. Confusion (adolescence)</li>
  <li>Intimacy vs. Isolation (early adulthood)</li>
  <li>Generativity vs. Stagnation (adulthood)</li>
  <li>Integrity vs. Despair (old age)</li>
</ol>

<h2>LEARNING <span class="topic-badge badge-part1">Part 1 - Topic 6</span></h2>

<p><strong>Learning</strong> is any relatively permanent behavior change brought about by experience or practice. Different from <strong>maturation</strong>, which is genetically controlled.</p>

<h3>Classical Conditioning (Ivan Pavlov)</h3>
<p>Learning that occurs with reflexive, involuntary behavior.</p>
<h4>Elements:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Unconditioned stimulus (UCS):</strong> Stimulus automatically evoking involuntary response.</li>
  <li><strong>Unconditioned response (UCR):</strong> Innate response naturally evoked by UCS.</li>
  <li><strong>Conditioned stimulus (CS):</strong> Stimulus paired with UCS that elicits conditioned response.</li>
  <li><strong>Conditioned response (CR):</strong> Learned response evoked by CS after CS-UCS pairing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Other Concepts:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stimulus generalization:</strong> Tendency to respond to stimulus similar to original CS.</li>
  <li><strong>Stimulus discrimination:</strong> Tendency to stop making generalized response.</li>
  <li><strong>Extinction:</strong> Disappearance of learned response after removal of UCS.</li>
  <li><strong>Spontaneous recovery:</strong> Reappearance of learned response after extinction.</li>
  <li><strong>Higher-order conditioning:</strong> Strong CS paired with neutral stimulus.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Phobia and Taste Aversion</h3>
<p><strong>Phobia:</strong> Learned through classical conditioning (Watson & Rayner).</p>
<p><strong>Conditioned taste aversion:</strong> Organism becomes nauseated after eating particular food.</p>

<h3>Operant Conditioning (B.F. Skinner)</h3>
<p>Learning that applies to voluntary behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Law of Effect (Thorndike):</strong> If pleasurable consequence follows response, it will tend to be repeated.</p>

<h4>Types of Reinforcement:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Positive reinforcement:</strong> Response followed by presenting pleasurable stimulus.</li>
  <li><strong>Negative reinforcement:</strong> Response followed by removing unpleasant stimulus.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Other Concepts:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Shaping:</strong> Reinforces simple steps leading to desired complex behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Punishment:</strong> Presents unpleasant event making response less likely.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cognitive Learning Theory</h3>
<p>Learning requires cognition or influence of organism's thought processes.</p>
<p><strong>Latent learning (Tolman):</strong> Learning remains hidden until needed.</p>
<p><strong>Learned helplessness (Seligman):</strong> Dogs in inescapable situation failed to escape when possible.</p>

<h3>Observational Learning (Albert Bandura)</h3>
<p>Learning by watching others perform specific actions.</p>
<p><strong>Four elements for observational learning:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Attention:</strong> Pay close attention to model's actions.</li>
  <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Remember what was observed.</li>
  <li><strong>Reproduction:</strong> Mimic what was observed.</li>
  <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Desire to apply what was learned.</li>

<h2>MEMORY <span class="topic-badge badge-part2">Part 2 - Topic 7</span></h2>

<h3>The Memory Process (Kalat, 2021)</h3>
<p><strong>Encoding</strong> is the first process of memory, which is the set of mental operations that people perform on sensory information to convert that information into a form that is usable in the brain's storage system.</p>
<p><strong>Storage</strong> is holding on to information for some time. It has different lengths depending on the stage of memory being used.</p>
<p><strong>Retrieval</strong> is recovering the stored information into a form that can be used.</p>

<h3>The Information Processing Model</h3>
<p>This model of memory assumes that processing information for memory storage is similar to how a computer processes memory in a series of three (3) stages:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sensory memory</strong>: Information enters the nervous system through sensory systems
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Iconic memory</strong>: Visual sensory memory that lasts only a fraction of a second</li>
      <li><strong>Echoic memory</strong>: Short memory of something a person has just heard</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Short-term memory (STM)</strong>: Also called working memory, holds about 7±2 chunks of information for about 30 seconds without rehearsal</li>
  <li><strong>Long-term memory (LTM)</strong>: System in which memories to be kept more or less permanently are stored with unlimited capacity</li>
</ol>

<h3>Types of Long-term Memory</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Procedural memories</strong>: Memories for skills, habits, and conditioned responses</li>
  <li><strong>Declarative memories</strong>: Memories of general facts and personal experiences
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Semantic memories</strong>: Contain general knowledge</li>
      <li><strong>Episodic memories</strong>: Contain personal information</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Implicit memories</strong>: Difficult to bring into conscious awareness (procedural)</li>
  <li><strong>Explicit memories</strong>: Those that a person is aware of possessing (declarative)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cues That Help People to Remember</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Retrieval cues</strong>: Words, meanings, sounds encoded simultaneously as a new memory</li>
  <li><strong>Encoding specificity</strong>: Physical surroundings are encoded as retrieval cues</li>
  <li><strong>State-dependent learning</strong>: Physiological or psychological states are encoded as retrieval cues</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Do We Forget?</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Curve of forgetting</strong>: Information mostly lost within one hour after learning (Hermann Ebbinghaus)</li>
  <li><strong>Memory Trace Decay Theory</strong>: Physical memory trace decays with disuse over time</li>
  <li><strong>Interference</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Proactive interference</strong>: Older information interferes with retrieving newer information</li>
      <li><strong>Retroactive interference</strong>: Newer information interferes with retrieving older information</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Encoding failure</strong>: Failure to process information into memory</li>
</ul>

<h3>Amnesia</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Retrograde amnesia</strong>: Memory of the past (before injury) is lost</li>
  <li><strong>Anterograde amnesia</strong>: Memory for anything new becomes impossible</li>
  <li><strong>Alzheimer's disease</strong>: Primary memory difficulty is anterograde amnesia</li>
  <li><strong>Infantile amnesia</strong>: Inability to remember events before age 2 or 3</li>
</ul>

<h3>Research on Memory</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Elizabeth Loftus found that people constantly update and revise their memories</li>
  <li><strong>Flashbulb memories</strong>: Vivid memories of emotional events but not necessarily accurate</li>
  <li><strong>Constructive processing</strong>: Memories are reconstructed from various bits of information</li>
  <li><strong>False memories</strong>: Fabricated or distorted recollections of events</li>
  <li><strong>Misinformation effect</strong>: Incorporating misleading information into memories</li>
</ul>

  </li>
  <li><strong>Drive Reduction Theory</strong>: Motivated state caused by physiological need
    <ul><li>Example: Desire to drink water when thirsty</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Arousal Theory</strong>: Human desire for optimal level of arousal
    <ul><li>Example: Seeking new experiences or challenges</li></ul>
